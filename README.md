# Welcome to CultureMania
We are young talents from Boğaziçi University, taking Cmpe451 course that requires us to make this great project about "Cultural Heritage".

Cultural Heritage concerns physical artefacts as well as intangible characteristics of groups that are inherited from one generation to another.  Cultural Heritage may be tangible or not.  They are often related to a group of people, who may or may not come from a certain region.  They describe patterns and customs associated with groups of people.  Due to the erosion of cultural information, its digital recording has gained much importance.
